# Redbus Data Scraping and Filtering with Streamlit
### Project Overview:
The "Redbus Data Scraping and Filtering with Streamlit Application" aims to revolutionize the transportation industry by providing a comprehensive solution for collecting, analyzing, and visualizing bus travel data. This project utilizes Selenium for web scraping to automate the extraction of detailed information from Redbus, including bus routes, schedules, prices, and seat availability. The data is stored in an SQL database and visualized using Streamlit, allowing for dynamic filtering and user-friendly interaction.
### Introduction:
he objective of this project is to streamline data collection and provide powerful tools for data-driven decision-making in the transportation industry. By automating the extraction of bus travel data and offering a dynamic filtering interface, the project aims to significantly improve operational efficiency and strategic planning.
### Features
##### Automated Data Extraction: 
  Uses Selenium to scrape detailed bus travel data from Redbus.
##### Efficient Data Storage: 
  Stores the scraped data in an SQL database for easy retrieval and management.
##### Dynamic Filtering: 
  Utilizes Streamlit to provide an interactive interface for filtering and visualizing the data.
##### User-Friendly: 
  Easy to use and navigate, making it accessible for users with varying technical backgrounds.
### Technologies Used:
- **Selenium:** For web scraping and automated data extraction.

- **MySQL:** For storing and managing the scraped data.

- **Streamlit:** For building the interactive web application.

-**Python:** The core programming language for the project.
### Usage
1. **Scrape Data:** Use the Selenium script to scrape data from Redbus and store it in the MySQL database.
2. **Launch Streamlit App:** Start the Streamlit application to interactively filter and visualize the data.
3. **Filter Data:** Use the dynamic filtering options in the Streamlit app to view bus schedules, routes, prices, and seat availability based on your preferences.

### Future Work
- **Scalability:** Extend the project to scrape data from multiple sources and handle larger datasets.
- **Enhanced Analysis:** Implement advanced analytical tools and visualizations for deeper insights.
- **User Features:** Add more user-friendly features such as alerts for price drops or seat availability notifications.
- **Integration with Other Systems:** Integrate with other transportation systems for a more holistic approach to data management.
